# Neural-Nets

A simple neural net that will take new rgb colors and classify it as

- red-ish
- green-ish
- blue-ish
- orange-ish
- yellow-ish
- pink-ish
- purple-ish
- brown-ish
- grey-ish


# Running

To run this project type `npm i ` and `node index.js`

Once in the REPL you can type `train`.

After training is done you can classify new colors with `rgb [r] [g] [b]`
eg `rgb 1 2 3`.

Type `help` for other commands you can use.
